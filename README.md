# Spotify Analytics
This was a group project with a team of 5 where we analyzed Spotify data using Apache Spark. I worked on analyzing the distribution of emotions across different genres of music. I utilized Apache Spack to analyze the data from a dataframe and create a heatmap. I then used Flask and Python to create a web interface where users can click on different emotions and genres to find the number of appearances of the specific comobination in the database.
